A SORP is a statement that is sent annually to members of a defined contribution pension scheme. It contains an estimate of the value of their pension fund upon retirement.

The calculator allows a user to enter the details of their plan and returns the value of their fund at a specified retirement age. The SORP Calculator outputs the periodic payment received, given that the fund is used to purchase an annuity. Additionally, a graph showing the fund value over time, and a table displaying the time progression of the fund is generated.
